# GADPA debate timer
This small project is just a substitute to the conventional whiteboard we usually use in previous years because the room which we booked only have projectors available ðŸ˜­.
Questions on debates are hardcoded as this was meant for a one-time use.
Nothing much to see besides from that :D
